I wake from my slumber
I wish I could call you up
Miss how you'd put your love on me
Boy, you've got my number
Wish I could feel your touch
Wish you could follow up on me
You never know when to chill
Always talk 'bout keep it real
Only til you've have your fill
Then you wanna cry ill will
Really thought you knew the deal, oh
Oh well, I guess that's what happens
When two fools be falling in love
Mixing some pain and some passion
Nothing is ever enough
If you can take my hand
I promise we'll find love again, love again, yeah, yeah
If you can take my hand
I promise we'll find love again, yeah, oh (I promise)
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
You don't even say what's up
'Round your boys you act so tough
Like you've never been in love
If you don't quit acting up
Alone is where you're gon' end up, I promise
You may think that I'm crazy
You should ask around 'bout me
Put your trust in me, baby
Ay, yeah
I wake from my slumber
I wish I could call you up
Miss how you'd put your love on me (Hey)
Boy you've got my number
Wish I could feel your touch
Wish you could follow up on me
Hold on until the end
Hold on until you can't extend
I'll be clinging on to you
I'll be clinging on to you
And then we get again
All waiting around and then
Circle back around to you
Coming back around to you
I'm coming back around and
Even on your worst day
Love you in the worst way (Worst way)
Circling around for eternity
Going through the motions you're turning me, internally
Drifting on my own again
Reaching out to hold your hand
I want to be alone with you
Can I be alone with you? (Can I be alone with you?)
Can I be alone with you?
If you can take my hand
I promise we'll find love again, love again, oh
If you can take my hand
I promise we'll find love again
Ever
