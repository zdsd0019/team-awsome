[Verse 1]
In every breath there's life
Between my teeth a knife
Pronounced us man and wife
For evermore
Cause once you've found your thrill
You move in for the kill
I'd chase you up the hill
And all through time

[Chorus]
And now my memory
Seems to be failing me
What once was fantasy
Is all I've ever known

[Verse 2]
The thing I miss the most
Lives in some demon host
I know you're not a ghost
Just down the street
I am a spinning man
A living ceiling fan
If two could only hang
In the same room once again

[Chorus]
And now my memory
Seems to be failing me
What once was fantasy
Is all I've ever known
